This site is dedicated to showing off the programming projects that I have already completed in the past or am in the process of completing. The site itself is a project. During the summer of 2023, I learned how to code php and run it locally, as well as the basics of docker and aws. This site is currently running off of 3 docker containers, which are all running on an EC2 instance.
